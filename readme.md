# WordSnake

A mildly stressful multiplayer word game written in Elm and Express.

## Run

You'll need to have Elm installed globally (`npm install -g elm`). Afterwards, some setup:

`git clone ..`
`npm install`
`elm package install`

Run `npm run dev` (server) and `npm run watch` (webpack) in two separate terminal windows. Refresh every time front-end has changed. Stay tuned for a nicer setup.
