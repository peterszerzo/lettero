## About Lettero

Oh, words. So complex and full of surprises. We can hardly make head or tail of them, right? Literally.

Lettero is a tiny little game allowing players to compete against each other decyphering words that are displayed in a less conformist fashion. In a circle. Looping around. Scattered all over.

Made with care by [Peter](http://www.peterszerzo.com) with the generous coding time-support of [Airtame](https://airtame.com). Enjoy!
